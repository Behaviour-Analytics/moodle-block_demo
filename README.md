# Demostration Block #

This plugin provides a simple working template for demonstration and
development purposes.

The block contains a global setting that enables a custom welcome message to
be displayed in the block. This setting is available from
Site administration -> Plugins -> Plugins overview, then searching for the
Demo plugin and clicking its settings link.

The block also contains instance settings that enables a custom question and
answer form in the block. These allow the teacher to enter a question that the
student can respond to, then the student will see the response from the teacher.
This same functionality exists in the separate page available through the link
in the block. That page will also show all the strings that have been entered
for that user, but not for any other users.
